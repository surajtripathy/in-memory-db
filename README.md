## Data Structures
To create the transactions we use a stack - the time complexity to append/pop in a list is O(1)
To keep the key - value mapping we use a dictionary - the time complexity to add/lookup in a dictionary is O(1)

## Usage
- Extract the zip file to a folder
- Generate and activate a virtualenv by `virtualenv venv` and `venv/bin/activate`
- To run the test file use `python in_mem_db\test_db.py`
- To run the main file use `python in_mem_db\main.py`
